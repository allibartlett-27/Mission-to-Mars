# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this week's assignment was to create a web app to showcase information about Mars from different websites. Information included is the latest news headline and image from Nasa, facts about Mars and images of the hemispheres. Our web app is also set up to scrape the data so it provides the most accurate information. 

I styled the web app with a blue background, underlined each title on the page and changed the color of the Mars Facts table to make it stand out.
